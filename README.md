The SARSA class encapsulates the SARSA algorithm. The constructor initializes the Q-table with all values set to zero, and the class provides methods to get the best action for a given state, choose an action using epsilon-greedy exploration, update the Q-table based on the observed reward and next state, decay the exploration rate, and print the Q-table.
The main function defines the problem space (a gridworld with a specific size), creates an instance of the SARSA agent, and runs the SARSA loop for a specified number of episodes. In each episode, the agent starts in a random state, chooses the first action, performs actions until reaching the terminal state, and updates the Q-table using the SARSA update rule. Finally, the learned Q-table is printed.
